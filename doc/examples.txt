There are two major modes, interactive and non-interactive. The
interactive mode is started when barrel is called without a command.


Non-Interactive Examples:

- Create a RAID5 of size 1 GiB on partitions on the disks
  sd[b-e]. The underlying partitions are also created:

  # barrel create raid --level 5 /dev/sd[b-e] --size 1g

- Create a RAID5 of size 1 GiB with 3 devices plus 1 spare
  device. The underlying partitions are created on disks on the pool
  "HDDs (512 B)". A XFS is placed on the RAID:

  # barrel create raid5 --pool "HDDs (512 B)" --size 1g --devices 3+1 xfs


Interactive Examples:

- Show all disks:

  barrel[0]> show disks

- Create a RAID5 of size 1 GiB with 3 devices plus 1 spare
  device. The underlying partitions are created on disks on the pool
  "HDDs (512 B)". A XFS is placed on the RAID:
   
  barrel[0]> create raid5 --pool "HDDs (512 B)" --size 1g --devices 3+1
  barrel[1]> create xfs --path /test1
  barrel[1]> commit

  The command to create the RAID places the object of the RAID on the
  stack. The command to create the XFS takes that object of the stack
  and in return places the object for the XFS on the stack.

- Create a XFS filesystem of size 2g on a partition on one disks in
  pool "SSDs (512 B)":

  barrel[0]> create xfs --pool "SSDs (512 B)" --size 2g
  barrel[1]> commit

- Create a RAID5 of size 1 GiB with 3 devices plus 1 spare device. The
  underlying partitions are created on disks on the pool "HDDs (512
  B)". On the RAID a GPT in placed and inside the GPT a XFS is placed:

  barrel[0]> create raid5 --pool "HDDs (512 B)" --size 8g --devices 3+1 gpt xfs --size 1g --path /test2
  barrel[1]> commit


More commands for the interactive mode are: stack, undo, show pools,
show raids, show filesystems, quit, pop, dup, extend pool, reduce
pool.

Note: Pools are so far auto-generated at startup and not saved.
