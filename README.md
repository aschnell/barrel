barrel
======

Barrel is a command-line program for storage management. It can work
with file systems, LUKS, RAIDs and LVM. The main feature of barrel is
to combine the various tools needed to manage the different storage
systems in one tool. E.g. with a single command of barrel it is
possible to create partitions on several disks, create a RAID from
those partitions and create a file system on the RAID.
